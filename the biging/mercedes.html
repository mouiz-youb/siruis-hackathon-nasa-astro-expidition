            Mercedes-Benz German pronunciation: [mɛɐ̯ˈtseːdəsˌbɛnts, -dɛs-] ,commonly referred
            to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle 
            automotive brand established in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group 
            subsidiary established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg,
            Germany. Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles

            commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler Truck, a former 
            part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in late 2021
            . In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world,
            having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.
            The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901
            Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is
            widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled
            automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".
